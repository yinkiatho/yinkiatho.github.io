The website is user-friendly, offering a clean layout, pre-set and custom alerts, pricing options, and information about the team and mission.

## Features

Here is an overview of the rest of the website and the features it offers.

#### View Bills

The main goal was to provide users with up to date information about legislation before other news sources. One way we did this was to provide a recent bill widget that would allow <strong> other websites and our users </strong> to track the information they wanted.

#### Create Alert

Another way we did this was to provide a way for users to create custom alerts for legislation they cared about. This was done by creating a form that would allow users to input their information and then send it to our backend.
